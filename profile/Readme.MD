# The problem OpenLibro solves

Many digital books and research materials are controlled by centralized platforms (Amazon Kindle, Google Books, university paywalls). Access can be revoked, censored, or lost. 

Libraries and public knowledge repositories depend on government or donation-based funding, which is unreliable. Wikipedia, Internet Archive, and even public libraries face funding crises.

 Platforms track reading habits and sell user data. Readers lack control over their preferences, recommendations, and privacy. 

 Traditional digital libraries don’t reward contributors, curators, or engaged readers who add value to the ecosystem.

## IMPACT: Why This Matters

OpenLibro turns knowledge into a financially regenerative, censorship-resistant public good—combining AI, blockchain, and DeFi to ensure unrestricted, sustainable access to books and research worldwide. Users who curate, verify, or contribute insights earn library governance tokens or revenue shares from AI-generated services.

Our Flow blockchain-based library ensures permanent, censorship-resistant access to knowledge, owned by the community, not corporations. And our AI Librarian agent provides open-access AI research assistance, helping users analyze books, summarize texts, and cross-reference knowledge in a decentralized way.
